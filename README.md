# course-goals-manager
A simple React Native App to manage my Udemy course goals

I have been using this app to test different things I learned about React Native from my Udemy course online.
Mostly, I have been creating forms, where I can enter reminders that the app will then push to a list of my reminders.

## Installation and Setup

As this is an expo app, you have to install expo-cli first:
```bash
npm install expo-cli --global
```
Then you after cloning this repo, you should enter the project folder

```bash
cd course-goals-manager
```
and then start the expo app

```bash
expo start
```

Finally, you 'll see a webpage where you can launch your iOS or android simulators to test the app.
